# This is a *mostly* working mobile fork of the Discord Inspired theme for Silly Tavern.
 It also includes a fix for the Landing Page extension so the sidebar doesn't cover it.

## How do I apply the theme?
### Step 1: Install [Silly Tavern CSS Snippets](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-CssSnippets/)
Open Silly Tavern, go to the extensions page (three blocks icon) and click on install extension. Then paste "https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-CssSnippets/" into the text box on the popup. Then click save and relaunch Silly Tavern.
 
### Step 2: Go to [#releases](https://github.com/dumbbitchashlyn/st-discord-inspired/releases/) and download whichever CSS file you prefer.
 You will find two CSS files attached to the latest release. The only difference between them is whether or not the sidebar is center aligned or not.

 ### Step 3: Install the theme.
 Open Silly Tavern and click on the user settings icon (avatar with a gear). Then scroll down until you see "Custom CSS" and click on the icon next to it. At this point a new tab should open that says "CSS Snippets". Click on the import icon closest to the text, and select the CSS file you previously downloaded. Then click the checkbox marked "Theme". The theme should now be applied, and you can give the snippet a name if you want. You now can go back to Silly Tavern.

 

 


 The files inside of the fork currently are the same as the original version of this theme as I wasn't intending to release it on Github, but alas, here we are. The CSS files in [#releases](https://github.com/dumbbitchashlyn/st-discord-inspired/releases/) have all the updated CSS.
